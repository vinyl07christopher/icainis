            International Conference on Artificial Networks for Intelligent Systems is a forum for the presentation of innovative techniques and
            research findings in the field of Artificial intelligence. An intelligent system is one that employs Artificial Intelligence (AI)
            techniques to provide services (for example, as a component of a larger system) that enable integrated systems to recognise, reason,
            learn, and act intelligently in the real-world environment. The goal of artificial intelligence research is to create smart computer
            programmes that can make human-like predictions and decisions with ethical and social ramifications in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data Science interacts with fields such as machine learning and cognitive science, in addition to Big Data technology (Big Data). Data
            science is the process of analysing data and determining the best method for future data processing, sorting, sampling, and retrieval.
            Advanced Intelligent Systems include the use of intelligent systems such as artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, human-machine
            interface, control theory and control systems, and smart sensing systems in Industry, Medical Science, and daily lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope of the conference portrays a spectrum of developing areas in modern artificial intelligence including Big Data, Deep Learning,
            Data mining, Ambient intelligence, Expert systems, and other intelligent system-based approaches. Categories of acceptance for the
            conference are research articles illustrating research findings, surveying and industrial experiences describing major breakthroughs in
            the fields of Artificial Networks and Intelligent applications.
